Photos and Text
===============

I decided to rebuild Photos and Text (http://www.photosandtext.com) as an exercise to learn about web design. I chose to build it in Django because both Django and Python have a reputation for being very friendly and well documented (I'd never programmed anything before this)

The site is hosted on AWS and all photos are uploaded to CloudFront, other than that it's a pretty basic site.
